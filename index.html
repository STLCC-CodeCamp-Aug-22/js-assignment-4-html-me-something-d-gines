            <p>This is Danny Boy, also known as "Bub". He's an australian shepherd who's never been to Australia. We recieved Danny from a liter of puppies from some old family friends of my partner, Janika. She drove all the way from St. Louis to Pueblo Colorado to pick him up. Now this guy is almost 5, and what's really messed up is that he shares a birthday with Janika. Danny is very sweet and caring, but has unfortunately developed some anxiety and timidness since moving into the city and living through a pandemic. After 2 years of quarantine and few neighbors who were mean to him, he's extremely nervous and defensive around new people (Especially when he's protecting Janika). He loves car rides with the window down, his people friends, and his new sister-pet (even while being extrememly peturbed by her presence). When Danny Boy reaches level 6, he will naturally evolve into Daniel Man.</p>

            <img src="A4 Pictures/DojaCar.jpg" alt="Doja in the car" width = "175">
            <p>Doja Cat is new to the family and she's still Just Little&copy;. She's a domesticated long hair from Janika's mother's farm (there's always 10 to 16 cats on the farm. Some have been there forever, others come and go. There's a lot of liters.) Doja's momma is a very large and elegant cat and we hope she grows to be just as big. She isn't even 1 yet, having been born last October. She's kind of crazy (like most orange cats are) and isn't phased by anything. I can't count the amount of times she's gotten her paw caught in the door, or been stepped on, and she is completely unbothered. When she was spayed she was up and trying to run around by the next day (sedatives were the only thing keeping her safe from herself). She's very sweet and playful, but Danny Boy doesn't know what or how to play with her and usually just removes himself from the situation. Unfortunately, she hasn't met Doja Cat the artist. But.... she's Just Little&reg;. </p>

         <h2 class="headers">How much experience do they have?</h2>
            <p>Suprisingly enough, Doja Cat has already power leveled passed Danny Boy. You see, Danny is a level 72, Paladin, with 288 HP, while Doja Cat has already reached level 79 as a Ranger with 302 HP. After looking at the numbers and the event log, it does make sense that she has passed him so quickly. And, I can personally attest to how tough and unbothered she is by pain. Danny.... not so much.</p>
